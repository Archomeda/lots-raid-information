# Vale Guardian: Builds &ndash; Condition DPS Engineer
{% include templates/messages/build-unfinished.html %}

The Engineer is mostly ranged and will go for the **green circles**.
If the rotation is too complicated, focus on dealing as much burning as possible, and don't forget about vulnerability stacks.

When standing on a green circle, use your Healing Turret with a couple of blast finishers in order to heal other players that are standing next to you.
This will help you and your teammates to stay alive when the lightning strikes.

The Engineer should also keep an eye on **seekers** and slow them down with immobilizes or chill, or knock them away.
This is very important on the green circles.

During the split phase, the Engineer goes to the **Red Guardian**.

## Build
The Engineer uses Viper gear.
If Viper's is not available, use Sinister.
If Sinister is not available on a trinket, use Berserker's.
