# Vale Guardian: Builds &ndash; Condition Berserker
{% include templates/messages/build-unfinished.html %}

The Condition Berserker will mostly be in melee range of the Vale Guardian and use his sword and torch to deal as much condition damage as possible.
You build up your adrenaline, go berserk and use your F1 skill in order to increase your DPS even more.

During the split phases, the Condition Berserker goes to the **Red Guardian**.

## Build
The Condition Berserker uses Viper's gear.
If Viper's is not available, use Sinister.
If Sinister is not available on a trinket, use Rampager's.

### Armor
Ideally all the armor pieces have Superior Runes of the Scholar.

### Weapons
{% include templates/builds/weapon-skills.html profession="Warrior" mainhand="Sword" offhand="Torch" %}
{% include templates/builds/weapon-skills.html profession="Warrior" mainhand="Longbow" %}
Ideally these weapons have Sigils of Agony and Sigils of Smoldering.

### Utilities
{% include templates/builds/utility-skills.html healing="Healing Signet" utility1="Signet of Fury" utility2="&quot;For Great Justice!&quot;" utility3="Banner of Tactics" elite="Head Butt" %}
- Head Butt can be replaced with Battle Standard if needed
- If the Banner of Strength and Banner of Discipline aren't covered, use those instead of "For Great Justice!" and Banner of Tactics
