# Vale Guardian: Builds &ndash; Druid Healer
{% include templates/build_unfinished.html %}

The healer's job sounds very easy: keep everyone alive as much as possible.
Keep an eye on the HP of other players and heal accordingly.
Of course you should still do some damage to the Vale Guardian if possible, but it's not your main priority.

During the split phases, the tank goes to the **Blue Guardian**.

## Build
The healer can use both Zealot's gear or Berserker's gear, or a mix.
It depends if you're willing to spend the gold and time required for Zealot's gear or not, but Berserker's should suffice.
If you feel that the healing is lacking a bit, you can try to mix in some Healing Power from other stat types.
Just make sure to not go above the toughness level of the tank.
