# Vale Guardian: Builds &ndash; Utility Chronomancer
{% include templates/messages/build-unfinished.html %}

The Chonomancer's job is to provide as much alacrity and quickness as possible.
If executed correctly, this will increase the DPS output significantly.

During the split phases, the tank goes to the **Blue Guardian**.
As a Chronomancer with a sword, the Chronomancer has to boonstrip the Blue Guardian for it to become vulnerable to attacks if there is no Chonomancer tank.

## Build
The Chronomancer uses Assassin's gear.
If Assassin's is not available, use Berserker's.

### Armor
Ideally all the armor pieces have Superior Runes of the Chronomancer.

### Weapons
