# Vale Guardian: Builds &ndash; Power DPS Berserker
{% include templates/messages/build-unfinished.html %}

The Berserker will always be in melee range of the Vale Guardian and will share might stacks upon critting with the greatsword.
You build up your adrenaline, go berserk and use your F1 skill in order to increase your DPS even more.
When a group of players are down and are close together, use the Battle Standard to AoE resurrect them.

Only during CC phases (and split phases in order to kill the colored guardian), you swap to your mace/mace in order to CC the Vale Guardian.

During the split phases, the Berserkers split up and go to the **Green Guardian** and the **Blue Guardian**.
