# Vale Guardian
The Vale Guardian is the first encounter in the [Spirit Vale](../).

{% include templates/messages/optimal-gear.html %}

For this encounter, it's useful to have the **Blazing Speed Mushrooms** mastery unlocked (Itzel Lore tier 3).
There are Speed Boost Mushrooms near each pillar that will give you a buff that allows you to move 40% faster and your skills and actions to be 10% faster.
These buffs are only temporary for 20 seconds, but can be reapplied after.
