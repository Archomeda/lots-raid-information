# Vale Guardian: Composition
There are many compositions that are viable for fighting against the Vale Guardian.
The following roles are available:

- Tank
- Healer
- Power DPS
- Condition DPS

Generally, we run with:

- 1 [Chronomancer tank][site-spirit-vale-vale-guardian-builds-chronomancer-tank]
- 1 [Druid healer][site-spirit-vale-vale-guardian-builds-druid-healer]
- 1-3 [condition DPS Engineers][site-spirit-vale-vale-guardian-builds-condition-dps-engineer] and/or 0-2 [condition DPS Berserkers][site-spirit-vale-vale-guardian-builds-condition-dps-berserker]
- 2 [power DPS Heralds][site-spirit-vale-vale-guardian-builds-power-dps-herald]
- 2 [power DPS Berserkers][site-spirit-vale-vale-guardian-builds-power-dps-berserker]
- 1 [other power DPS profession][site-spirit-vale-vale-guardian-builds], preferably ranged

This doesn't mean that we can't tweak the setup during the raid.
But the setup should at least be similar to this one.

## Squad parties
We run with 2 full parties of 5 players, but there's no one fits all solution.

Generally, we want to have:

- As much of the ranged players together in a party
- The 2 Heralds divided between the parties
- The 2 Berserkers (power) divided between the parties
- The Chronomancer should *not* be in the same party as most of the ranged player

## Change history
