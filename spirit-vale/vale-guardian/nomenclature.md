# Vale Guardian: Nomenclature
In order to avoid confusion, we use the following terms in the Vale Guardian fight:

**Phase 1** or **first phase**
: The starting phase of the Vale Guardian when it's above 66% HP.

**Phase 2** or **second phase**
: The second phase of the Vale Guardian when it's between 33% and 66% HP.

**Phase 3** or **third phase**
: The third phase of the Vale Guardian when it's below 33%.

**Split phase**
: The recurring phase that occurs between the *numbered phases* (at 66% and 33%).
The Value Guardian splits into 3 separate Guardians: Red, Green and Blue.

**CC phase**
: The small recurring phase of the Vale Guardian where he stands still and shoots lots of small AoE projectiles all over the arena.
During this phase the Vale Guardian has to be hard CC'd as fast as possible (knockbacks, knockdowns, stuns, dazes, etc.).

**Phasing**
: The transitioning of the Vale Guardian from a *numbered phase* into the *split phase*.

**Arena**
: The area we are in when we are fighting against the Vale Guardian.

**Barrier**
: The semi-transparent white circle around the arena that prevents you from going both in and out.
It deactivates when the fight is over, either by killing the Vale Guardian or by wiping.

**Sector**
: The arena is divided into 3 sectors, visible by the markings on the ground.
Each sector has its own color (red, green, blue), which is visible when they are *active*, or by its pillar.

**Active sector**
: An active sector is a sector that has its markings lit up (in red, green or blue).
An active sector will cause significant damage each tick.

**Pillar**
: Each sector has its dedicated pillar.
Each pillar has a different color (red, green or blue), which is the same as the sector itself.

**Green circle**
: The green circles that spawn every 15 seconds at a random spot in the *same sector* as the Vale Guardian (or the Blue Guardian during a *split phase*).
They have a charge up delay of 5 seconds and it requires 4 people to stand on when it's charged up (3 during a *split phase*).

**Blue circle**
: The blue circles that spawn every 9 seconds on top of the players, with a charge up delay of 2 seconds.
These blue circles will teleport players when hit at the end of the charge.

**Seeker**
: The red orbs that respawn every 20 seconds and home into specific players (assumed to be random).
They deal significant damage to players that are close.
