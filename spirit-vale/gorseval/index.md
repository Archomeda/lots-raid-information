# Gorseval
Gorseval the Multifarious is the second encounter in the [Spirit Vale](../).

{% include templates/messages/optimal-gear.html %}

{% include templates/messages/error.html message="The mastery **Updraft Use** is mandatory (Gliding tier 2). You can't participate without having this mastery unlocked." %}

For this encounter, it's useful to have the **Rift Traveler** mastery unlocked (Forsaken Thicket tier 1).
While not required, it will save you time if you want to repair your gear, since you can interact with the ley rifts to travel back and forth.
