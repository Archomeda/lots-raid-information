# Gorseval: Builds &ndash; Chronomancer Tank
{% include templates/messages/build-unfinished.html %}

The tank's job is to kite Gorseval to specific locations.
The tank has to be careful with Gorseval's attacks and needs to keep it facing away from the rest of the players as much as possible.
Its attacks can be negated by dodging, blocking, evading or becoming invulnerable.

During the spirit phases, the tank goes to the correct direction at the barrier.
When Gorseval is there as well, pull the spirits to one location where they can be killed.

## Build
The tank should get **between 1400 and 1500 toughness** by any possible stat type that gives toughness (e.g. Knight's).
The rest should be filled in with either Assassin's or Berserker's gear.

### Armor
Ideally all the armor pieces have Superior Runes of the Chronomancer.

### Weapons

{% include templates/builds/weapon-skills.html profession="Mesmer" mainhand="Sword" offhand="Sword" %}
